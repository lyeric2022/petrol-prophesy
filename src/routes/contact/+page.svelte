	<p>Hey I'm Eric Ly!</p>

	<p>
		During my winter break, I made this site to develop my skills in Svelte,
		backend, and machine learning. For any collaboration, recruiting, or
		just chats, feel free to contact me, by visiting the site below!

		a little repetitive when I already had that on my personal site 👻)
